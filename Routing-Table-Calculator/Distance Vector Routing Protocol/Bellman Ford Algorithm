For each node ‘x’, 
Initialize the graph
For all destinations ‘y’ in ‘N’:
    if (y is a neighbor): 
        Dx (y) = c (x, y) 
    else: 
        c (x, y) = ∞

For each neighbour ‘w’
    Send the Distance Vector Dx = [ Dx(y): y in N] to w

Loop
    standby (until vector received from any neighbour ‘w’)
    For each ‘y’ in ‘N’:
        Dx(y) = min {c (x, v) + Dv (y)}
        If Distance Vector [Dx(y)] is modified for any ‘y’:
            Send the updated/modified Distance Vector
