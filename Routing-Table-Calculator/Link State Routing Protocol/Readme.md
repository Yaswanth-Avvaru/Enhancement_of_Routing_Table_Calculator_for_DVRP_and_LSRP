On to the implementation, the Link State Routing Protocol has been implemented in two codes. 
One with Dijkstra’s Algorithm (LSRouting.java) and the other one with Modified Dijkstra’s Algorithm (LSRP.java). 

In the main class we input the network topology that is the cost between the nodes in the network are provided and then the routing table calculator for each of the nodes (router) will be displayed in the text area of Java GUI. 

We run the Modified Dijkstra’s Algorithm taking each node as source and then compute routing tables for all routers individually.
